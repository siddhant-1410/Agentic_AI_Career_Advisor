# 🎯 AI Career Guidance System

A sophisticated multi-agent AI system that provides personalized career guidance, analysis, and professional email reporting. This project demonstrates the power of collaborative AI agents working together to deliver comprehensive career counseling services.



## 🌟 Overview

The application combines the analytical power of Mistral AI with specialized CrewAI agents and RAG-enhanced chatbot capabilities to provide users with personalized career insights, interactive consultations, and professional email reports.

Think of it as having your own personal career counseling team - each specialist focused on what they do best, working together to give you the most comprehensive and up-to-date career guidance possible.

## 🤖 Why Multi-Agent Architecture?

Traditional single-AI systems try to do everything, but they are like asking one person to be a researcher, writer, and technical specialist all at once. Our multi-agent approach assigns specialized roles:

- **🔍 Career Analysis Expert**: Deep research and market analysis
- **✍️ Professional Writer**: Crafting polished email reports  
- **⚡ Technical Delivery Specialist**: Handling email delivery and formatting
- **🧠 Smart Memory Assistant**: Providing current information through RAG

This specialization means each task gets expert-level attention, resulting in higher quality outputs and better user experience.

## 🎯 Model Selection (Why These Models?)

Earlier I used OpenAI and Google Gemini models via API through their respective dashboards, but the problem was they exceeded their quota. Hence, I decided to go with Mistral Open Source models with a generous limit of 1 billion tokens on the free tier while maintaining excellent performance characteristics.
